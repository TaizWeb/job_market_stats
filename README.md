## What Is This?
This is a collation of data-points across the HN API. Essentially, this computes statistics on job postings from the "Who is Hiring" threads on HackerNews. This can give an idea of which technologies are sought after over time.

## Why Even Make This?
Mostly because I wanted an idea of what the technologies the job market demanded, so I could get a headstart on the "next big thing". Making my side-projects based around this can ensure that I'm keeping up with the technologies that will be valuable tomorrow.
